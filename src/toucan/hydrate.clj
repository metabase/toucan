;; #### *DISCLAIMER*
;;
;; This I wrote this code at 4 AM nearly 2 years ago and don't remember exactly what it is supposed to accomplish,
;; or why. It generates a sort of path that records the wacky ways in which objects in a collection are nested,
;; and how they fit into sequences; it then returns a flattened sequence of desired objects for easy modification.
;; Afterwards the modified objects can be put in place of the originals by passing in the sequence of modified objects
;; and the path.
;;
;; Nonetheless, it still works (somehow) and is well-tested. But it's definitely overengineered and crying out to be
;; replaced with a simpler implementation (`clojure.walk` would probably work here). PRs welcome!
;;
;; #### Original Overview
;;
;; At a high level, these functions let you aggressively flatten a sequence of maps by a key
;; so you can apply some function across it, and then unflatten that sequence.

(defn hydrate
  "Hydrate a single object or sequence of objects.


#### Automagic Batched Hydration (via hydration-keys)

  `hydrate` attempts to do a *batched hydration* where possible.
  If the key being hydrated is defined as one of some model's `hydration-keys`,
  `hydrate` will do a batched `db/select` if a corresponding key ending with `_id`
  is found in the objects being batch hydrated.

    (hydrate [{:user_id 100}, {:user_id 101}] :user)

  Since `:user` is a hydration key for `User`, a single `db/select` will used to
  fetch `Users`:

    (db/select User :id [:in #{100 101}])

  The corresponding `Users` are then added under the key `:user`.


#### Function-Based Batched Hydration (via functions marked ^:batched-hydrate)

  If the key can't be hydrated auto-magically with the appropriate `:hydration-keys`,
  `hydrate` will look for a function tagged with `:batched-hydrate` in its metadata, and
  use that instead. If a matching function is found, it is called with a collection of objects,
  e.g.

    (defn with-fields
      \"Efficiently add `Fields` to a collection of TABLES.\"
      {:batched-hydrate :fields}
      [tables]
      ...)

    (let [tables (get-some-tables)]
      (hydrate tables :fields))     ; uses with-fields

  By default, the function will be used to hydrate keys that match its name; as in the example above,
  you can specify a different key to hydrate for in the metadata instead.


#### Simple Hydration (via functions marked ^:hydrate)

  If the key is *not* eligible for batched hydration, `hydrate` will look for a function or method
  tagged with `:hydrate` in its metadata, and use that instead; if a matching function
  is found, it is called on the object being hydrated and the result is `assoc`ed:

    (defn ^:hydrate dashboard [{:keys [dashboard_id]}]
      (Dashboard dashboard_id))

    (let [dc (DashboardCard ...)]
      (hydrate dc :dashboard))    ; roughly equivalent to (assoc dc :dashboard (dashboard dc))

  As with `:batched-hydrate` functions, by default, the function will be used to hydrate keys that
  match its name; you can specify a different key to hydrate instead as the metadata value of `:hydrate`:

    (defn ^{:hydrate :pk_field} pk-field-id [obj] ...) ; hydrate :pk_field with pk-field-id

  Keep in mind that you can only define a single function/method to hydrate each key; move functions into the
  `IModel` interface as needed.


#### Hydrating Multiple Keys

  You can hydrate several keys at one time:

    (hydrate {...} :a :b)
      -> {:a 1, :b 2}

#### Nested Hydration

  You can do recursive hydration by listing keys inside a vector:

    (hydrate {...} [:a :b])
      -> {:a {:b 1}}

  The first key in a vector will be hydrated normally, and any subsequent keys
  will be hydrated *inside* the corresponding values for that key.

    (hydrate {...}
             [:a [:b :c] :e])
      -> {:a {:b {:c 1} :e 2}}"
  [results k & ks]
  {:pre [(valid-hydration-form? k)
         (every? valid-hydration-form? ks)]}
  (when results
    (if (sequential? results)
      (if (empty? results)
        results
        (apply hydrate-many results k ks))
      (first (apply hydrate-many [results] k ks)))))
